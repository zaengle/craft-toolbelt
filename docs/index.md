# Introduction

> Because logic belongs in PHP, not Twig.

## What

A collection of Twig enhancements to help you develop better, cleaner Craft CMS templates more quickly.

## Why?

Because simple templates are easier to understand, and code that is easier to understand is easier to maintain.

Craft CMS is a great tool for building websites, but it's not perfect. One of the biggest issues is that its very 
power and flexibility means it's very easy to end up with a lot of logic in your templates.

## What you get...

1. [Utility functions](./01-utility-fns)
2. [String helpers](./01.5-string-helpers)
3. [SVG helpers](./02-svg-helpers)
4. [Query/Collection helpers](./03-query-helpers)
5. [Eager loading helpers](./04-eager-loading-helpers)
6. [Debugging helpers](./05-debugging-helpers)
7. [Operators](./06-operators)
